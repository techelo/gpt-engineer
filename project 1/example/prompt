I would like you to construct a fully functional web user interface (UI) for the GPT-engineer utilization. This interface should offer easy-to-use functionalities and good user experience. The task encompasses designing the front-end layout, ensuring optimal user navigation as well as developing the back-end code to ensure seamless integration with GPT-engineer. Ensure that users can easily enter and receive information from the GPT-engineer via this interface. The produced code should be clean, efficient, and maintainable. The interface should support all major web browsers and handle potential exceptions, providing users with necessary feedback.
Make sure to add a Title, history, Dark mode option, and that it has the instructions on how to use and settings where the user can put their own OPENAI API KEY
